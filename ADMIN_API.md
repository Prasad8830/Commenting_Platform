  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","secret":"make-me-admin-123"}'
```

**Example using PowerShell:**
```powershell

```

  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: 'user@example.com',
    secret: 'make-me-admin-123'
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

  "message": "User is now an admin!",
  "user": {
    "id": "68f0f333b76f07dcca39ceca",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "isAdmin": true
  }
}

### 1. Delete Any Comment

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4000/api/comments/COMMENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**

1. **Remove the make-admin endpoint in production:**
   - Delete `server/src/routes/admin.routes.js`
   - Remove the import and route from `server/src/index.js`

2. **Change the secret key** if you keep it:
   - In `admin.routes.js`, change `'make-me-admin-123'` to something secure
   - Use environment variables: `process.env.ADMIN_SECRET`

3. **Use database access** for production admin management:
   - Manually set `isAdmin: true` in MongoDB
   - Don't expose admin promotion endpoints

4. **JWT Token includes admin status:**
   - When a user becomes admin, they must **logout and login again**
   - The new JWT token will include `isAdmin: true`
   - Old tokens won't have admin privileges

**Q: The make-admin endpoint returns 404**
- A: Check that the server restarted after adding the admin routes
